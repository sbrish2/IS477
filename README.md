<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>The purpose of my project is to examine how Hollywood movie budgets, genres, and ratings relate to domestic box office performance. I approached this by combining two public datasets: the Rotten Tomatoes Movies dataset from Mendeley Data and the Top 1000 Highest Grossing Movies dataset from Kaggle. These datasets allowed me to analyze financial outcomes and critical reception together, giving me a clearer view of how different aspects of a film shape its commercial success.</p>
<p>My project is built around four research questions. First, whether higher production budgets tend to lead to better domestic box office performance. Second, how audience and critic ratings correlate with financial performance. Third, whether certain genres consistently appear among more successful films. Fourth, how budgets and sales have changed over time across genres. These questions guided my workflow from data cleaning to analysis and visualization.</p>
<p>Throughout this project, I focused on maintaining a transparent and reproducible process. Since I was working alone, I handled all stages myself, including dataset acquisition, cleaning, integration, and analysis. Because both datasets are small, I was able to store the raw files directly in my GitHub repository. Cleaned versions are shared through a Box folder, which follows the requirements for reproducibility and accessibility.</p>
<p>The merged dataset ended up much smaller than I expected. After cleaning and alignment, it included 539 films. This reduced size limits how representative the findings may be, but I think that the available data still gives a meaningful exploration of the research questions. I also chose to use domestic sales only. This kept the analysis consistent but meant that international markets, which are major drivers of revenue for many films, could not be included.</p>
<p>I also chose not to adjust for inflation. Doing that well would require additional economic data and much more cleaning work. It would also introduce its own assumptions, and I wanted to keep the focus on the features already included in the datasets. I also did not attempt to analyze qualitative film reviews, which would have required scraping or API access to entirely new datasets. These things, I decided, were outside the scope of my project.</p>
<p>Even with these limits, the combined dataset gives a workable view of how budgets, ratings, and genres interact with domestic box office results. My workflow reflects the structure of the course project requirements, and I documented each step in my Jupyter notebook. My final results include visualizations and correlation tables tied directly to the research questions.</p>
<p>Overall, this project aims to show how measurable film features relate to commercial and critical outcomes. While the dataset is imperfect, it still reveals significant patterns and helps to clarify some common assumptions about how movies succeed. My project also demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow that sticks to transparency, provenance, and reproducibility.</p>
<h2>Data Profile</h2>
<p>This project uses two publicly available datasets, to integrate two distinct data sources. Both datasets come from trusted platforms and use different schemas, formats, and attributes, which made integration meaningful. The first dataset, of Rotten Tomatoes Movies from Mendeley Data, includes ratings, titles, and release details. The second dataset, the Top 1000 Highest Grossing Movies from Kaggle, includes budget information, domestic revenue, and genres. Each dataset contributes a different part of the overall picture.</p>
<p>For the Rotten Tomatoes dataset, I used the CSV version. It includes thousands of films and provides both critic and audience ratings. To make it usable for integration, I cleaned column names, standardized the release year format, converted score strings to numeric values, removed duplicates, and dropped rows with missing values. The license provided through Mendeley applies to this dataset, so I do not redistribute the raw file. Instead, I provide a cleaned version through Box in accordance with the reproducibility guidelines.</p>
<p>For the Kaggle dataset, I also used the CSV version. It includes financial information and genre classifications for the 1000 highest grossing domestic films. I removed columns that were irrelevant to my research questions, standardized numeric fields for budget and domestic sales, removed duplicates, and dropped missing values. The Kaggle platform license covers the dataset, and I cite it rather than attempt to redistribute it.</p>
<p>After cleaning each dataset separately, I used movie title and release year as join keys. This meant I needed to standardize row data formatting, particularly for the year field. Even with this alignment, many films did not match across datasets. This reduced the merged dataset to 539 films. While smaller than expected, this size still allowed for analysis across all of my research questions. The reduced overlap likely reflects gaps in coverage between the two sources.</p>
<p>All raw data files are stored in a data folder within the repository. Cleaned data is stored in the Box folder that I link in the README. My Jupyter notebook performs all cleaning and integration steps, which satisfies the provenance and documentation requirements. I also chose a simple folder structure to keep everything clear: the data folder, a results folder for generated outputs, and the notebook itself.</p>
<h2>Data Quality</h2>
<p>To meet the expectations for assessing and improving data quality, I followed the steps covered in the course modules on profiling and cleaning. Both datasets required its own cleaning process due to differences in format, coverage, and attribute types. The Rotten Tomatoes dataset originally contained more than twelve thousand films, so the main task was to standardize formatting and reduce inconsistencies. The release date column needed to be converted into a simple year field, and the score columns needed to be converted from percentage strings to numeric values. I removed duplicate entries and dropped rows with missing values. After these steps, the dataset was reduced to just over eight thousand films.</p>
<p>The Kaggle dataset required a different approach. Since the dataset already focused on a subset of films, my goal was to remove unnecessary columns and prepare the numeric fields for integration. I dropped columns because they either duplicated information or were irrelevant to the research questions. Budget and revenue fields needed cleaning to remove symbols and convert the values into integers. I also removed duplicate entries and dropped rows containing missing values. This reduced the Kaggle dataset from one thousand films to 763.</p>
<p>When merging the datasets, I used movie title and year as the join keys. Despite cleaning and standardizing formats, many films did not match across the two datasets. This reflects the natural mismatch between a broad ratings dataset and a more selective revenue dataset. The merged dataset contains 539 films. This smaller size can affect the strength of the patterns observed, and I acknowledge this as a limitation of the project.</p>
<p>Overall, the quality improvement steps focused on making the data internally consistent, usable for integration, and aligned with the research questions. Although the merged dataset is smaller than I anticipated, it is still strong enough to explore general trends. The cleaned datasets and all steps in the process are fully documented in the Jupyter notebook.</p>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>My findings come directly from the visualizations and tables in my Jupyter notebook. For the first research question, I examined the relationship between production budgets and domestic sales. The patterns show a positive relationship, meaning that higher budgets often, but not always, correspond with higher domestic gross. Several exceptions appear, showing that high spending does not guarantee strong performance and that low-budget films can still succeed. This complicates the idea that budget size alone determines financial outcomes.</p>
<p>For my second research question, I studied how critic and audience ratings relate to domestic sales. The correlations are moderate. Films with stronger ratings tend to perform better, but the relationship is not absolute. It is possible for films with average ratings to gross well, just as it is possible for highly rated films to underperform. This shows that ratings influence but do not dictate financial success.</p>
<p>For my third research question, I looked at which genres appeared more frequently among higher-grossing films. Some genres cluster near the top of the revenue distribution, but no single genre consistently dominates. This suggests that genre contributes to expectations and audience interest, but it is not the sole factor that determines success.</p>
<p>For my last research question, I examined trends over time. More recent films tend to have higher budgets, which I expected, but domestic revenue doesn't increase at the same rate. Without adjusting for inflation, the patterns are difficult to interpret beyond general directional trends. Still, the data shows that budget growth over time has not always resulted in proportionate increases in domestic performance.</p>
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>There are several directions that could strengthen my project if more time and data were available. The most significant would be adjusting all financial figures for inflation. This would allow much clearer comparisons across decades. It would require external economic data and additional cleaning steps, but it would make long-term trends far more meaningful. Another extension would include international box office revenue. Many films now earn most of their income outside the United States, so focusing only on domestic sales does give an incomplete picture.</p>
<p>A third direction would be to expand beyond my two datasets. For example, adding information about directors, actors, franchises, and release seasons could reveal additional factors that affect critical reception and financial performance. These features can play a major role in shaping audience expectations. Another extension would involve analyzing actual review text using sentiment analysis. That would require collecting data through APIs or scraping.</p>
<p>Finally, future work could explore causal relationships rather than descriptive ones. This would involve building models that test how different factors influence outcomes. While that is outside the scope of my project, it would provide a richer understanding of what drives film success.</p>
